This is a light vim color scheme, made from scratch.
The UI elements are complete - I didn't skip stuff (I hope) like some other themes do.
Has GUI color as well as 256 color support, although the background of the 256 color
variant couldn't match the intended color too well.

Works better if the font is not a single pixel bitmap. I think this is the fault of it
being a light color scheme.

Keep in mind I am not a programmer, so the syntax color choice might be off or something,
although seeing how bad most of the other color schemes are...

Best to check the screenshots below.
